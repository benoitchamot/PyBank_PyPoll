# Description of process:
# - read the entire input CSV file
# - for each row, add vote count (one line = one vote) to candidate
# - for each candidate, calculate % of vote = # vote / total votes
# - select the candidate with higher % of vote as winner
# - print output on terminal and to file Analysis/vote_results.txt

# Import all necessary modules
import os
import csv

# Navigate to election data CSV file

        total_votes += 1

        if row[2] not in candidates:

        # Else (if the candidate is already in the list) ...
        else:
